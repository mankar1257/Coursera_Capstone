# **The best area to visit and Venues around it in the city of Pune**

# Using TripAdvisor and Foursquare APIs

##

## **Introduction and Business Problem :**

**Pune** , also called **Poona** , **city** , west-central Maharashtra state, western India, at the junction of the Mula and Mutha rivers. Called &quot;Queen of the Deccan,&quot; **Pune** is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples. The **city** first gained importance as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas in the 17th century.

As the city grows and develops, it becomes the attraction for most of the people around the world, looking for the Maharashtrian culture and modern technology going parallelly.

Developers, investors, visitors, and/or city planners have an interest in knowing about the best area to look and different venues around it.

Does the Open Data project have specific enough or thick enough data to empower decisions to be made or is it too aggregate to provide value in its current detail? Let&#39;s find out.

## **Data**

To understand and explore we will use the free data provided by the two well known APIs

- TripAdvisor
- Foursquare

1. TripAdvisor Developers Access to Restaurants data: [https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint\_78468c15-57d2-4992-aa01-cc0fc6d90d8a](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint_78468c15-57d2-4992-aa01-cc0fc6d90d8a)

2. TripAdvisor Developers Access to Attractive places data: [https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint\_73742daa-7e6e-4884-9572-5398e12d70c2](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint_73742daa-7e6e-4884-9572-5398e12d70c2)

3. TripAdvisor Developers Access to Hotels data: [https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint\_e9209769-cf4d-478f-93f3-1b83d96fec26](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tripadvisor1?endpoint=apiendpoint_e9209769-cf4d-478f-93f3-1b83d96fec26)

4.Foursquare Developers Access to venue data: [https://foursquare.com/](https://foursquare.com/)

Using this data will allow exploration and examination of the different areas in the city. These APIs will let us gather the data for our project.

Now we have the restaurant data, attraction data and hotel data with the access to all the venues around it

From the restaurant data, we will find out the places with high rated restaurants ( All types of restaurants ). Similarly from the Attraction data, we will find out the area with high rated attraction places and from hotels data, we will find out the high rated hotels and also from all this we will figure out the best area to visit and then what are some good venues around it using foursquare API.

Let&#39;s see what can be done with this :).
